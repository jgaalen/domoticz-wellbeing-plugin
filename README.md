# domoticz-wellbeing-plugin
Domoticz plugin for Electrolux / AEG Wellbeing Air Purifiers

This plugin reads your AEG Air Purifier values and lets you command the Workmode, Fanspeed and Ionizer

## Installation
From your domoticz home directory:
```
cd plugins
git clone https://github.com/jgaalen/domoticz-wellbeing-plugin.git
systemctl restart domoticz
```

## Tested on
- AEG Air Purifier AX7

I think it should work for AX5 and AX9 too, but not tested
